An elderly wardrobe sulks in the corner, one of the doors hanging slightly open, as if the wardrobe's got its shirt untucked. As you walk through the room, your feet tangle in abandoned laundry.
    - Dust motes dance in the beams. Grime coats the windows. Laundry—yours, Anzu's—carpets the floor, though a space has been cleared in front of the full-length mirror. The rolltop desk gapes open, its surface covered by journals of <a class='footnote' title='Zoology and botany and their thaumoturgical siblings'>natural</a> and <a class='footnote' title='Alchemy.

/*You undress and in deference to the gathering chill outside, put on pajamas. You carefully braid your hair, to keep it from tangling while you sleep, and say the Shema. Anzu busies himself with removing his make-up.
You get into bed.
"Look away, darling," Anzu says. "Give me privacy, nu?" You oblige, turning to look at the wall. Presently, Anzu turns off the light and slips into bed beside you, wearing a truly antique linen night-dress that covers him from neck to ankle. */

= prop
* {dressed==true} [look in the mirror] You look in the mirror. Your reflection stares back, mournfully.
You're a young ... well, it gets tricky, there. You live and present as both male and female, depending on your inclination that day. Your precise gender eludes you. Maybe there is no precision for you and your home is in the liminal space between _fairy_ and _transfeminine_.
Regardless. You're young and painfully thin and sallow. Your red hair falls to your waist in rambunctious waves. You have a long, pointy nose that dominates a narrow, long face. Gray eyes peer suspiciously from behind thick glasses. On your forehead, shining like Czarevna Lebed's star, are three silver eye-spots, eternal reminder that the mother who sired you had been a shoggot, that you are a changeling.
* {forkState ? floor && dressed==true} [pick up the fork] Bracing yourself, you awkwardly crouch down and pick up the fork. Your back, the tendons in your legs, your shoulders all complain, like you're ninety instead of twenty-seven. You straighten and your knees make a horrible crunching sound.
Absent-mindedly, focusing too much on the pain in your joints, you shove the fork into the pocket of your jeans. You're sure to find it again, at least.

/* * (anzu_pillow_talk) {pillow_talk()} [you can sleep, now] You settle down into a comfortable position and pull Anzu close. He clings.
  * * "Um. Are you okay?"[] you say. You know the answer, you realise with a sinking heart.
  "No," says Anzu, faintly. "It's ... oh, it's stupid, darling. Never mind. Sleep."
  "Um, like, if you're sure?" you say. He nods. You kiss his nose. "Um. Try to sleep well? I love you."
  "I love you too," he says, and he sounds rueful. "Good night."
  * * [kiss him goodnight] You kiss him, once on the mouth and once on the temple.
  "Love you," you say. "G'night." He mutters something back and then sighs.
  "Good night, darling," he says, his voice peculiarly heavy. "I love you, too."
  - - Anzu drifts off to sleep and, in time, so do you.
