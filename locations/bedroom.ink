    - A tarnished mirror stands sentinel just out of reach of the beam. Other bulky shapes loom in the darkness—an ancient <a class="footnote" title="A little too big for the room. By rights it belongs in the master bedroom, which currently houses Anzu's personal library.">four-poster bed</a>, Anzu's rolltop desk, three mismatched bedside tables. An elderly wardrobe sulks in the corner, one of the doors hanging slightly open, as if the wardrobe's got its shirt untucked. As you walk through the room, your feet tangle in abandoned laundry.
    - Dust motes dance in the beams. Grime coats the windows. Laundry—yours, Anzu’s—carpets the floor, though a space has been cleared in front of the full-length mirror. The rolltop desk gapes open, its surface covered by journals of <a class="footnote" title="Zoology and botany and geology.">natural</a> and <a class="footnote" title="Alchemy. Necromancy. Astronomy. The grisly sciences that delve wrist-deep into the thaumaturgical.">unnatural</a> philosophy and at least five mugs containing varying amounts of mouldering tea.

* {ready_for_bed(1)} [get ready for bed]
~ dressed = false
You undress and in deference to the gathering chill outside, put on pajamas. You carefully braid your hair, to keep it from tangling while you sleep, and say the Shema. Anzu busies himself with removing his make-up. He seems to be avoiding talking to you, which {grudge==true:is rather welcome right now|rather upsets you}.
You get into bed.
"Look away, darling," Anzu says, tossing the used make-up wipe over his shoulder. "Give me <a class="footnote" title="Anzu never lets you see him in his binder. When you fuck, both of you are partially clothed, but Anzu mostly just undoes a few fastenings and shifts clothes around rather than do anything as revealing as _undress_.">privacy</a>, nu?" You oblige, turning to look at the wall. Presently, Anzu turns off the light and slips into bed beside you, wearing a truly antique linen night-dress that covers him from neck to ankle. It billows out in front, hiding the swell of his chest.
* {ghostly_signs()} [wake up?] You wake up some time later, quite suddenly. <>

= prop
* {dressed==true} [look in the mirror] You look in the mirror. Your reflection stares back, mournfully.
You're a young ... well, it gets tricky, there, doesn't it? You live and present as both male and female, depending on your inclination that day. Your precise gender somewhat _eludes_ you. Maybe there is no precision for you and your home is in the liminal space between _fairy_ and _transfeminine_.
Regardless. You're young and painfully thin and sallow.
  * * [look again] Your red hair falls to your waist in rambunctious waves. You have a long, pointy nose that dominates a narrow, long face. Gray eyes peer suspiciously from behind thick glasses. On your forehead, shining like Czarevna Lebed's star, are three silver eye-spots, eternal reminder that the mother who sired you had been a shoggot, that you are a changeling.
    * * * [and look again] You're wearing an oversized pink cardigan, with purple elbow patches and lilacs embroidered in metallic thread. Your jeans are jeans, to be sure, but they're silver, glittering like the tail of a mermaid. On your feet are blue fluffy slippers with bunny ears and large, curious eyes embroidered close to the toe.

* {forkState ? floor && dressed==true} [pick up the fork] Bracing yourself, you awkwardly crouch down and pick up the fork. Your back, the tendons in your legs, your shoulders all complain, like you're ninety instead of twenty-seven. You straighten and your knees make a horrible crunching sound.
Absent-mindedly, focusing too much on the pain in your joints, you shove the fork into the pocket of your jeans. You're sure to find it again, at least.

* (anzu_pillow_talk) {pillow_talk()} [you can sleep, now] You settle down to sleep, the aches of the day ambushing you all at once, now that the darkness has hidden all the things that usually hold your attention.
  * * {grudge == false} [pull Anzu close]
  ~ raise(trust)
  ~ hold_anzu = true
  You pull Anzu close to you, wrapping your arms around his waist. He makes an indistinct but clearly pleased noise.

    "Love you," he mutters, sleepily.
    ~ raise(trust)
      * * * * “Love you, too[.”],” you say.
      * * * * [say nothing] You say nothing, but hold him tighter.

  - - and concentrate on blanking your mind. It's not easy. Thoughts, panicked, tangled, random and mundane, line up like soldiers at morning drills and march through your head.
  After some time spent in silence, enough that you think he must've fallen asleep, Anzu speaks up, his voice thin and needy in the night.
  "Lyuba? Lyova?"
  - - (opts_beit)
  * * {hold_anzu == false && grudge == false} [pull him close] You put your arm around his waist and pull him close, resting your chin on his shoulder.

  * * “Nu?”[] you say, muzzily. “Something wrong?” {hold_anzu==true:Anzu wriggles in your embrace and|Anzu} turns to face you. Even in the dark, you can see the pain in his expression.
  “You, ah, don't think of me as a woman, yes?” he says, hesitantly. His voice is pleading. His eyes are open wide, vulnerable and defenceless.
    - - - (opts_gimel)
    * * * {grudge == true} [sigh heavily] You sigh heavily. This again. But you can't be cruel to him and withhold an answer just because you're still mad. You still love him, after all.

    * * * [frown in confusion] Doesn't he remember the last time you talked about this? Oh well. You don't mind reassuring him again. After all, you love him.
    -> opts_gimel
    * * * [reassure him]
    “Well, um,” you begin, praying you've chosen the right track. “I'm not attracted to women? I'm attracted to you. So, like, um. I'd say I don't?”
    He's silent for long enough that you think that's the end of it. Then he makes a small sound, halfway between a sob and a sigh.
    “Thank you,” he croaks. His plummy upper-class accent is gone, replaced by a harsher, working-class tone that betrays his childhood in the Yisraeli ghettoes of Svet-Dmitrin.
    {hold_anzu==false:{grudge==true:In spite of yourself, you pull him close.|You pull him close.}|You kiss his temple, gently.}
    “Don't worry,” you say. “Um. I believe you? I believe you're what you say you are.”
    “Oh, I know that,” he says, morosely (but sounding posh again). “I don't know if _I_ believe me.” Then he falls silent and remains so.
    You drift off to sleep.
